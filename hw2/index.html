<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>

<p>
  In this homework, I implemented Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision, carried a similar principle over to implement Bezier surfaces, worked through understanding the half-edge data structure, implemented Phong shading, implemented the edge flip and edge split re-meshing operations, and finally worked on loop subdivision for mesh upsampling. Working on the algorithms behind this mesh editor was pretty cool — the recursive nature of de Casteljau’s was initially concerning to me, but it seems like at least for this simple program, it was very quick in terms of performance.
</p>
<p>
  From completing this assignment, I learned the half-edge data structure well and how to traverse it, and also realized how many bugs a single pointer mis-assignment could cause.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

<p>For this part, I used de Casteljau’s algorithm to evaluate Bezier curves. Here’s how it works. First, note (as given by the spec) that a “Bezier curve of degree n is defined by (n+1) control points.” Starting with those (n+1) control points, for one iteration of the process, linearly interpolate n intermediate points between the control points, using a weighting of t, which affects the interpolation as: \(p’_i = (1-t)p_i + tp_{i+1}\). Define the new intermediate points created as the new “layer” of points — my implementation of the algorithm uses a function which calculates one iteration at a time for a certain t. We find a single point on a bezier curve (each point corresponds to a weighting, t) by recursively finding intermediate points of successive layers until you’re left with one point. Now, to generate the whole curve, you would repeat the above process for different t (ranging from 0 to 1).</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
<p>Now, we can use the same idea from part 1 in part 2, to create Bezier surfaces (3D space). Rather than a single parameter t (which will get us a point on the Bezier curve), we are now parameterized by u and v (which will get us a point on the Bezier surface). </p>
<p>The idea remains very similar (note 2D points -> 3D points), with the <code>evaluateStep</code> function (like in part 1), which will calculates one step, providing us with the next “layer” of intermediate points (3D points in an array). This function is utilized by the <code>evaluate1D</code> function which will take in a 1D-array of the original control points (one row at a time), and continuously move from layer to layer until you are left with one point left; remember this point is a point on a Bezier curve specified by a row of the control points grid. Note that our parameter “t” (as specified in part 1’s linear interpolations) is going to be specified by “u.” Finally, in the outermost <code>evaluate</code> function, we are working with an NxN control point grid. We define a “moving bezier” curve, which runs perpendicular and across all the bezier curves specified by the rows of the grid. We call <code>evaluate1D</code> on each row (setting t = u), store the results in an array of points (defining the moving bezier) and call <code>evaluate1D</code> one last time on this result (setting t = v), and we obtain a single point (corresponding to the u and v) on the bezier surface.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-weighted Vertex Normals</h3>
<p>To implement area-weighted vertex normals, I just iterated through all the faces surrounding the given vertex. For each face, I calculated its normal vector by taking the cross product of two of its position vectors, and in the end made a resultant vector by adding them all up, then normalizing it. This normalized vector is the unit normal at the vertex passed into this function.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<p>To implement the edge flip operation, I first traversed the local two triangles given by the edge, to store each attribute (half edges, vertices, edges, faces) in variables. From there, it was just manually setting each component according to the picture below:</p>

<div align="middle">
  <img src="./images/EdgeFlip.png"/>
  <figcaption align="middle">This was the scheme used. It is generalizable!</figcaption>
</div>

<p>Since the half edges are what leads to the changes in structure (as the other components point to it — this was an interesting note), I modified these first with setNeighbors. From there I set each remaining component to the corresponding half edges. For convenience, faces were set to the “new” (reassigned from what they previously were) half edges.</p>

<p>The debugging journey was quite unfortunate — when setting neighbors, I had accidentally been setting the twin attribute to the twin of the next attribute by accident, rather than to the twin of the current half edge. Note that for both parts 4 and 5, I exit the function and return an unmodified result if either face that the edge is a part of is on a boundary loop.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<p>To implement edge split, I followed a similar approach to part 4, grabbing all the relevant elements that currently exist between the two triangles. Next, I created the new elements — 1 new vertex, 3 new edges, 2 new faces, and 6 new half edges. From there, in the spirit of part 4, I updated each half edges’ attributes, as well as set the remaining elements’ corresponding half edges. </p>
<p>This one was tricky, as it had even more pointers to reassign. I ran into a similar problem as in part 4, accidentally looking at the next attribute (of the setNeighbors function) rather than the current half edge when setting the twin. Referencing the variable names with my image below helped, however:</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<p>To perform loop subdivision to upsample the mesh, I followed the 5 steps provided: computing the new positions for all the vertices in the input mesh (with  <code>(1 - n * u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum</code>), computing the new vertex’s position in the middle of an edge (with <code>3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)</code>), splitting every original edge in the mesh, flipping any new edge (resulting from the split previously) that connects an old and new vertex, and lastly updating all the vertex positions with our results from steps 1 and 2. </p>
<p>In terms of debugging, I was obtaining some odd, hard to bug behavior (the shape kept stretching, would lose faces, or would cave inwards, etc.). What fixed it was realizing that if we do multiple iterations of upsampling, the boolean attributes from the previous iteration of new elements would still be marked as true, when it is now false. Thus, at the end of the function, I had a clean-up, iterating through all the vertices and edges that set boolean attributes to false. I also had to ensure the numbers were not doing integer operations, and lastly, I made all edges from splitting new (so my for loop wouldn’t hang forever), and added an extra boolean attribute that indicated whether the edge came from a split (to determine which edges to flip).
</p>
<p>It’s interesting — if you continue to loop subdividing, the cube almost becomes somewhat “lemon-shaped” (but has more protrusions). The sharp corners are the parts that protrude. Note that if we presplit edges (shown below), and then run the loop subdivision, the asymmetry is drastically reduced! The upsampled cube basically looks like a die. </p>

</div>
<p>The reason why we may observe that preprocessing with flips and splits will increase the symmetry and makes sure that there is a more uniform subdivision that occurs. It is likely that once you upsample, the effects become more and more drastic.</p>
<p>Honestly though, for other shapes in the dae folder however, the upsampling did not make the model look like portions were “protruding.”This might be the case specifically because of the reason above — more edges, i.e. “splits” allowed for subdivision to be more uniform.</p>
